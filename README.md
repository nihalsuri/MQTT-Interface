# MQTT Interface
 Python application that can send and receive data to/from an MQTT broker.

 ## Getting Started
 Clone the repository, activate the virtual environment and install all dependencies: 
 ``` 
 git clone https://github.com/nihalsuri/MQTT-Interface.git
 python3 -m venv venv
 call venv\Scripts\activate.bat
 pip install PyQt5
``` 
Make sure to also add your own "Simulated_sensor_data.csv" file to the root of the project so that there is something to publish on the broker, if the name of the file is something different please updated the ".gitignore" file as well to keep the sensor data local.
